<p>SmartRochambeau is a single player Rock-Paper-Scissors game featuring four
different AI opponents, developed as an individual project for Professor
Gudrun Socher's CPE 305 at Cal Poly, Fall 2016.</p>

<p>SmartRochambeau can be run by double clicking on the JAR or from the command 
line using java -jar SmartRochambeau.jar.</p>

<p>SmartRochambeau keeps track of win-loss-tie statistics and supports saved games.</p>

<p>SmartRochambeau features four AI opponents:</p>

<ul>
<li>A random AI as a control, which simply selects a random throw every round.</li>
<li>A Markov Chain AI modeled using nine states and three intermediate states, 
which answers the question, "Considering what the player threw last and 
whether or not he won, what is he likely to throw next?". At any given time, 
the current state is determined by the player's last throw and the result of 
that round, e.g., "Rock, win". Each state contains frequencies logging how 
often, when the game is at that current state, the player has moved according 
to each of the three intermediate states, which contain only a throw, e.g., 
"Paper". For example, the state "Rock, win" would contain three numbers 
corresponding to how often, after playing Rock and winning, the player then 
threw Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Based on those numbers, the AI can predict 
the player's most likely next move. The AI trains as it runs, updating the 
frequencies once it knows the outcome of the current round before it moves to
the next state.</li>
<li>A Naive Bayes AI -- implemented mostly as an experiment, not because I thought
it was necessarily a good algorithm for this problem -- that attempts to
answer the question, "Considering the player's last few throws, what is he
leading up to throwing?". The idea being, a Markov-Chain-based is vulnerable
because Rock-Paper-Scissors doesn't really satisfy the Markov Property; what
the player does next is not solely dependant on what he did last. The Naive
Bayes AI attempts to defeat 'longer' strategies wherein the player makes a
few moves to set his opponent up for a later move. The AI maintains a queue
of the player's last few throws as well as nine frequencies for how often each
individual throw 'led up to' each of the other throws. For example, if the
last three throws were "Rock, Paper, Rock", the AI can look at how often,
historically, Rock and Paper have indivdually led up to Rock, Paper, or
Scissors, then combine those probabilities using Bayes Rule. Like the Markov
Chain AI, the Naive Bayes AI is capable of training as it goes, though this
makes it vulnerable to overfitting and thus long term shifts in strategy.</li>
<li>A Pattern Matching AI, which I personally predicted would do best of the 
three, that attempts to answer the same question as the Naive Bayes AI, but
based on the pattern of the individual throws, not their general overall
frequencies. The AI maintains a complete ternary tree of throws to allow
for faster pattern matching, with each possible pattern represented as a
unique path from root to a leaf, and each leaf, as you might expect, contains
frequencies for each of the three throws. The Pattern Matching AI, too, is
capable of training as it runs..</li>
</ul>
